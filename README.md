Kurento Utils for Node.js and Browsers
======================================

> Notes: 
> Source code can be found in [kurento-utils-github-repo](https://github.com/LeoHaoVIP/kurento-utils-universal)

*kurento-utils-js* is a browser library that can be used to simplify creation and handling of [RTCPeerConnection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection) objects, to control the browserâ€™s [WebRTC API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API). However, the official kurento-utils-js is no longer maintained, and problems might occur when using the official library.

This library is an optimized version of kurento-utils-js [v6.18.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kurento-utils/v/6.18.0), currently it adds supports for screen sharing for mainstream browsers (as well as Electron) without extra plugins.


Installation instructions
-------------------------

Be sure to have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) in your system:

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

To install the library, it's recommended to do that from the [NPM repository](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kurento-utils-universal):

```bash
npm install kurento-utils-universal
```

Alternatively, you can download the code using git and install manually its dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeoHaoVIP/kurento-utils-universal.git
cd kurento-utils-universal
npm install
```

Updates on Official kurento-utils Library
======================================
- Update enum values of `sendSource`

    The official kurento-utils support two kinds of send sources, which are `webcam` and `screen`. In this updated library, we have provided four commonly used sharing modes, which are `audio`|`screen`|`camera`|`mix`.
    
    When a user is sharing on `mix` mode, the camera and screen media are mixed into one single media stream via  [MultiStreamMixer](https://github.com/muaz-khan/MultiStreamsMixer).
    
    [![mix-demo.png](https://i.postimg.cc/rm3kJCxk/mix-demo.png)](https://postimg.cc/ZB82YNw7)
    
- Add supports for free-plugin screen sharing
  
  Most browsers now naturally support `getDisplayMedia` for screen sharing. In this updated library, we utilized it and implemented `getScreenMedia`, thus users can share their screen without installing extra browser plugins. 
  
  Besides, considering that many developers are writing WebRTC codes on [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) framework, we also implemented `getScreenMediaForElectron` and `getMixMediaForElectron` using [desktopCapturer](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/desktop-capturer) module of `Electron`.
